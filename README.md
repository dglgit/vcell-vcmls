# vcell-vcmls
Virtual Cell (VCell) BioModels are stored as custom XML files with a `.vcml` extension. They can be opened in any text editor, however the VCell application is needed to fully visualize each file (download at https://vcell.org/run-vcell-software). In VCell, open a `.vcml` file `File > Open > Local...` and select the file. Each file contains the reaction network and simulation parameters. Each model can also be accessed within VCell's search feature by the file name. 

`Construct3_Cycle3_dgl.vcml` describes the BioModel for the synthetic transcription factor construct.

`FAB_GFP_Construct_v1_1_Douglas.vcml` describes the Biomodel for the PFOA-sensitive human liver fatty-acid-binding protein fusion protein with GFP (hlFAB-GFP). 

`PFAS_Detectorv3_v1_1_Douglas.vcml` describes the BioModel for the prmA promoter-based detection method used in my 2023 iGEM project. 

`SF_detector.vcml` describes the proof-of-concept bioreporter design used in my independent research project on multicellular simulations.
